# Example of 'is' Operator
a = [10, 20, 30]
b = [10, 20, 30]
c = a

print(a is b)  # False (Different objects in memory)
print(a is c)  # True (Same object in memory)

# Example of 'in' Operator
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in numbers)  # True (3 exists in the list)
print(6 in numbers)  # False (6 is not in the list)
